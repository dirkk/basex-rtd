# About the documentation project

We decided to open the documentation process to our community. To us this is a natural consequence from all the positive experience we made during the last years. 


We know, 

 * writing good documentation is essential for both our users & developers 
 * constant feedback helps improving so please feel free and discuss our articles or file requests for new ones 
 * some of you have very profound knowledge of BaseX and its infrastructure. You are very welcome to contribute Articles & Edits. 

## Where to start 

If you have not signed up yet: this is the moment to [create your account](http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Special:UserLogin). 


You may now start by either creating articles or choosing from a list of pages that might need some maintenance: 

 * [Most wanted articles](http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Special:WantedPages)
 * [List of short articles](http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Special:ShortPages)
 * [ List of pages that have no outgoing links](http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Special:DeadendPages)

### Wanted Articles

You may also add links to Topics you would like to see in our documentation: 


Surround a word with double brackets: [[Wanted Topic]] and that word will be highlighted in red. 


### Guidelines for new Articles 

For now we only have few guidelines we used when creating new articles. Feel free to extend or change this list. 

** Don't be afraid **

** Article Title **

** Categories **

** Code Examples **

** Syntax Highlighting **


## Writing Articles

Please see [Help:Editing](http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Help:Editing) for some information on _Wiki Syntax_.
