# Official Releases

Our releases, packaged for various platforms, are linked from our homepage. They are updated every 2-8 weeks: 

 * `http://basex.org/download`

Our file server contains links to older releases as well (but we recommend everyone to stay up-to-date, as you'll get faster feedback working with the latest version): 

 * `http://files.basex.org/releases`

## Stable Snapshots

If you are a developer, we recommend you to regularly download one of our stable snapshots, which are packaged and uploaded several times a week: 

 * `http://files.basex.org/releases/latest/`

Note that the offered snapshot files are replaced as soon as newer versions are available. 


## Code Base

If you always want to be on the cutting edge, you are invited to [watch and clone](Git.md) our GitHub repository: 

 * `https://github.com/BaseXdb/`

We do our best to keep our main repository stable as well. 


## Maven Artifacts

The official releases and the current snapshots of both our core and our API packages are also deployed as [Maven](Maven.md) artifacts on our file server at regular intervals: 

 * `http://files.basex.org/maven/org/basex/`

## Linux

BaseX can also be found in some Linux distributions, such as Debian, Ubuntu and archlinux (Suse and other distributions will follow soon): 

 * Debian: [http://packages.debian.org/sid/basex](http://packages.debian.org/sid/basex)
 * Ubuntu: [http://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/basex](http://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/basex)
