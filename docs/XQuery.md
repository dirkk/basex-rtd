# XQuery
 


 
Welcome to the Query Portal, which is one of the [Main Sections](index.md) of this documentation. BaseX provides an implementation of the W3 [XPath](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-30/) and [XQuery](http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-30) languages, which are tightly coupled with the underlying database store. However, the processor is also a flexible general purpose processor, which can access local and remote sources. High conformance with the official specifications is one of our main objectives, as the results of the [XQuery Test Suite](http://dev.w3.org/2006/xquery-test-suite/PublicPagesStagingArea/XQTSReportSimple_XQTS_1_0_2.html) demonstrate. This section contains information on the query processor and its extensions:
