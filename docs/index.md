BaseX GUI
# Welcome to the documentation of BaseX!
[BaseX](http://basex.org) is both a light-weight, high-performance and scalable XML Database and an XQuery 3.0 Processor with full support for the W3C Update and Full Text extensions. It focuses on storing, querying, and visualizing large XML and JSON documents and collections. A visual frontend allows users to interactively explore data and evaluate queries in realtime (i.e., with each key click). BaseX is platform-independent and distributed under the free BSD License (find more in [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BaseX)). 

 
This documentation is based on **BaseX 8.0**. It can also be downloaded as [PDF](Documentation.md). Features that have recently been added or changed are highlighted and can be [searched for](http://docs.basex.org/index.php?search=7.8). 

 
## [Getting Started](Getting Started.md)

The [Getting Started](Getting Started.md) Section gives you a quick introduction to BaseX. We suggest you to start with the [Graphical User Interface](Graphical User Interface.md) as this is the easiest way to access your XML data, and to get an idea of how XQuery and BaseX works.
